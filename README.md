# Computer-Vision-Modules



So this is a series of OpenCv modules I worked upon.
-- Hand Detection
-- Pose Estimation (left elbow coordinates on display)
-- Face Mesh
-- Face Detection
Mediapipe library was used along with some other computer vision libraries. The code is provided, and overall these modules has been used in subsequent projects. 
The output is being shown below.
